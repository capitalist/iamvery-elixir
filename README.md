# Iamvery Elixir

[![Build Status](https://github.com/iamvery/iamvery-elixir/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iamvery/iamvery-elixir/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/iamvery.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/iamvery)

A set of Elixir utilities for myself and others.
Using this Hex package as a test bed for ideas that may be eventually spun off as separate projects or open source contributions.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `iamvery` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:iamvery, "~> 0.4.0", only: :test}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/iamvery>.
